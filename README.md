# Prospective Learning Simple Transformer 

Simple-Transformer is a repository featuring two key components:

1. **simple_model**: This is a transformer model specifically designed for text generation tasks. It offers a straightforward yet effective solution for generating text based on given prompts or inputs.

2. **classifier_model**: An innovative binary classification model that excels at handling small-scale classification tasks. Despite its compact size, this model delivers impressive performance and accuracy. Currently only this model was implemented with the prospective configuration.

For any inquiries or feedback, please don't hesitate to open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Prospective Configuration

To optimize the performance of the tiny transformer model from our repository, we recommend applying the prospective configuration provided in our dedicated repository.
